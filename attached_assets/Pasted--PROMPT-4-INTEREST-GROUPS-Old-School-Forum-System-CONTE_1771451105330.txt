# PROMPT 4: INTEREST GROUPS — Old School Forum System

## CONTEXT
This is a React Native Expo 54 app using TypeScript, React Navigation, Reanimated, AsyncStorage, and a custom theme system. You are adding an Interest Groups feature styled after classic online forums (phpBB, vBulletin era). This is NOT a modern social feed — it should feel like an old school message board with borders, data-dense rows, reply counts, view counts, and thread listings.

## EXISTING PATTERNS — FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY
- Theme: `import { useTheme } from "@/hooks/useTheme"` → `const { theme } = useTheme()`
- Colors: `theme.text`, `theme.textSecondary`, `theme.backgroundRoot`, `theme.backgroundSecondary`, `theme.backgroundTertiary`, `theme.accent` (#E31837), `theme.border`, `theme.success`, `theme.warning`
- Typography: `import { ThemedText } from "@/components/ThemedText"` → types: `"h1"`, `"h2"`, `"h3"`, `"body"`, `"bodyBold"`, `"caption"`, `"small"`
- Spacing/Radius: `import { Spacing, BorderRadius } from "@/constants/theme"`
- Icons: `import { Feather } from "@expo/vector-icons"`
- Haptics: `import * as Haptics from "expo-haptics"`
- Animations: `import Animated, { FadeIn, FadeInDown } from "react-native-reanimated"`
- Navigation: `import { useNavigation } from "@react-navigation/native"` with `NativeStackNavigationProp<RootStackParamList>`
- Safe areas: `import { useSafeAreaInsets } from "react-native-safe-area-context"`

## WHAT TO BUILD

### PART 1: Mock Data — Add to `client/lib/mockData.ts`

Add these interfaces and data AFTER the existing exports (do NOT modify existing data):

```typescript
// ===== INTEREST GROUPS (Forum System) =====

export interface ForumGroup {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string; // Feather icon name
  color: string; // hex color for icon badge
  memberCount: number;
  threadCount: number;
  postCount: number;
  lastActivity: string; // relative timestamp
  lastPostBy: string;
  lastThreadTitle: string;
  isOfficial: boolean; // admin-created vs user-created
  createdBy: string;
  category: "lifestyle" | "business" | "fitness" | "mindset" | "skills" | "other";
}

export interface ForumThread {
  id: string;
  groupId: string;
  title: string;
  author: {
    name: string;
    tier: string;
    postCount: number;
    joinDate: string;
  };
  createdAt: string; // relative timestamp
  replyCount: number;
  viewCount: number;
  lastReplyBy: string;
  lastReplyAt: string; // relative timestamp
  isPinned: boolean;
  isLocked: boolean;
  hasNewPosts: boolean;
  preview: string; // first ~100 chars of OP
}

export interface ForumPost {
  id: string;
  threadId: string;
  author: {
    name: string;
    tier: string;
    postCount: number;
    joinDate: string;
    streak: number;
  };
  content: string;
  createdAt: string;
  isOP: boolean;
  likes: number;
  liked: boolean;
  quoteOf?: string; // post ID being quoted
  quotedAuthor?: string;
  quotedContent?: string;
}

```

### PART 2: Storage — Add to `client/lib/storage.ts`

Add these storage keys and interfaces AFTER the existing proof system storage (do NOT modify existing storage):

```typescript
// In the KEYS object, add:
FORUM_JOINED_GROUPS: "@operator_forum_joined_groups",
FORUM_USER_THREADS: "@operator_forum_user_threads",

// Interfaces
export interface JoinedGroup {
  groupId: string;
  joinedAt: string;
}

// Storage functions
export async function getJoinedGroups(): Promise<JoinedGroup[]> {
  try {
    const data = await AsyncStorage.getItem(KEYS.FORUM_JOINED_GROUPS);
    return data ? JSON.parse(data) : [];
  } catch {
    return [];
  }
}

export async function joinGroup(groupId: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const groups = await getJoinedGroups();
    if (!groups.find(g => g.groupId === groupId)) {
      groups.push({ groupId, joinedAt: new Date().toISOString() });
      await AsyncStorage.setItem(KEYS.FORUM_JOINED_GROUPS, JSON.stringify(groups));
    }
  } catch {}
}

export async function leaveGroup(groupId: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const groups = await getJoinedGroups();
    const filtered = groups.filter(g => g.groupId !== groupId);
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(KEYS.FORUM_JOINED_GROUPS, JSON.stringify(filtered));
  } catch {}
}
```

### PART 3: SocialScreen.tsx — Add "Groups" tab

**File:** `client/screens/SocialScreen.tsx`

Modify the existing TABS array from:
```typescript
const TABS = ["Announcements", "General", "Founders", "Saved"];
```
To:
```typescript
const TABS = ["Groups", "Announcements", "General", "Founders", "Saved"];
```

When the "Groups" tab is selected, render a `GroupsDirectory` component (defined below in the same file or imported) INSTEAD of the posts list. This directory shows all `forumGroups` from mockData in the old-school forum style.

**Groups Directory Layout (rendered when Groups tab is active):**

At the top: A header bar with "INTEREST GROUPS" label and a "CREATE GROUP +" button (right aligned). The create button navigates to `CreateGroup` screen.

Then a search bar: Simple TextInput with magnifying glass icon, `placeholder="Search groups..."`, filters the group list by name as user types. Style: `borderWidth: 1, borderColor: theme.border, backgroundColor: theme.backgroundSecondary, borderRadius: BorderRadius.sm` (sharp corners, not pill-shaped — old school).

Then the group list. Each group row should look like this (OLD SCHOOL FORUM STYLE):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [icon]  75 HARD Veterans                    ★ OFFICIAL│
│         For those who have completed 75 Hard...       │
│─────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│ 342 threads · 8,921 posts · 12,847 members           │
│ Last: IronMike — "Day 75 done. Here's what nobo..." │
│                                              2m ago   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Key styling for old-school feel:
- Use `borderWidth: 1` and `borderColor: theme.border` on each group row (NOT rounded cards with shadows)
- `borderRadius: BorderRadius.sm` (4px max, sharp corners)
- Stats row uses monospace-style numbers: `fontFamily: Platform.select({ ios: "Menlo", default: "monospace" })`
- Separate stats with centered dots ` · ` in `theme.textSecondary`
- "Last:" line truncated with `numberOfLines={1}`
- Icon badge: small square (not circular) with colored background, rounded only slightly (4px)
- Official groups get a small "OFFICIAL" badge in `theme.accent` color
- Each row is a `Pressable` that navigates to `GroupBoard` screen with `{ groupId: group.id, groupName: group.name }`
- Rows stacked vertically with NO gap — borders touch (like classic forum boards)
- Category sections: Group the list by category with small header rows: "FITNESS", "BUSINESS", "LIFESTYLE", "MINDSET", "SKILLS", "OTHER" — header rows have `backgroundColor: theme.backgroundTertiary`, small text, uppercase, letterSpacing: 2

### PART 4: GroupBoardScreen.tsx — Thread Listing

**New file:** `client/screens/GroupBoardScreen.tsx`

This is a classic forum thread listing. It receives `{ groupId, groupName }` from navigation params.

**Header area:**
- Group name as title (already handled by navigation header)
- Below header: a bar showing "X members · Y threads · Z posts" and a "NEW THREAD" button (navigates to `CreateThread` with `{ groupId }`)
- A "JOIN" / "JOINED ✓" toggle button. Uses `getJoinedGroups()` / `joinGroup()` / `leaveGroup()` from storage.

**Thread list layout — CLASSIC FORUM STYLE:**

Column header row (sticky):
```
TOPIC                                    REPLIES  VIEWS  LAST POST
```
Style: `backgroundColor: theme.backgroundTertiary`, uppercase, fontSize: 11, letterSpacing: 1, fontWeight: "700", `borderBottomWidth: 1`

Then each thread row:

```

- Reply count: if > 0, show in bold. If > 50, show in `theme.accent` (hot thread)
- View count: formatted with commas (e.g., "1,289")
- Last reply: "username · time ago" in small text
- Each row: `borderBottomWidth: 1, borderBottomColor: theme.border`
- Pinned rows separated from regular rows by a slightly thicker border (2px)
- Row onPress navigates to `GroupThread` with `{ threadId, threadTitle, groupId }`

**Empty state** (for groups with no threads): "No threads yet. Be the first to start a discussion."

Filter threads by `groupId` from `forumThreads` mock data.

### PART 5: GroupThreadScreen.tsx — Thread View with Posts

**New file:** `client/screens/GroupThreadScreen.tsx`

This is the classic forum thread view showing OP and all replies. Receives `{ threadId, threadTitle, groupId }` from params.

**Thread header:** Thread title at top, full width, large text.

**Post layout — CLASSIC FORUM POST STYLE:**

Each post is a horizontal two-panel layout (like phpBB):

On mobile, since horizontal space is limited, use this stacked adaptation:

Key styling:
- Author info bar at top with name (bold), tier badge, streak fire emoji + number, timestamp right-aligned
- "Posts: X · Joined Y" line in caption size, `theme.textSecondary`
- OP gets an "[OP]" badge in `theme.accent` background
- Content area: `fontSize: 15, lineHeight: 24`, preserving `\n` line breaks
- **Quoted posts**: If `quoteOf` exists, show a quote block above the content with left border (4px, `theme.border`), dimmed background, italic quoted author name, and truncated quoted content
- Bottom action bar: heart/like count (left), Quote button, Reply button
- Post separator: `borderBottomWidth: 1, borderColor: theme.border`
- Post numbers: "#1", "#2", "#3" etc. in top-right corner, small, `theme.textSecondary`
- All posts stacked vertically, NO gaps between them (borders touching)
- FlatList with the thread data filtered from `forumPosts` by `threadId`

**Reply input at bottom:** Sticky bottom bar with:
- TextInput (multiline, max 3 visible lines, placeholder: "Write a reply...")
- "POST" button (right side, `theme.accent` background)
- This is for prototype display only — on press, show an alert "Reply posted!" and clear the input (don't actually save anything)

### PART 6: CreateGroupScreen.tsx

**New file:** `client/screens/CreateGroupScreen.tsx`

A simple form screen for creating a new interest group. Fields:

1. **Group Name** — TextInput, required, max 50 chars, character counter shown
2. **Description** — TextInput multiline, required, max 200 chars, character counter
3. **Category** — Horizontal chip selector: "Lifestyle", "Business", "Fitness", "Mindset", "Skills", "Other"
4. **Icon** — Grid of 12 selectable Feather icons: `shield, briefcase, heart, book-open, anchor, home, sunrise, phone-call, target, tool, coffee, globe`. Each in a 44x44 square touchable with border. Selected state: `theme.accent` border + background tint

**"CREATE GROUP" button** at bottom. On press: haptic, show Alert "Group Created!" (prototype only — no actual persistence needed), navigate back.

**Style:** Same old-school feel. Use `borderWidth: 1` on all inputs, sharp corners (`BorderRadius.sm`), no floating labels. Labels above each field in uppercase, letterSpacing: 2, fontSize: 11, fontWeight: "700".

### PART 7: CreateThreadScreen.tsx

**New file:** `client/screens/CreateThreadScreen.tsx`

Simple form for creating a new thread. Receives `{ groupId }` from params.

1. **Thread Title** — TextInput, required, max 100 chars, character counter
2. **Content** — TextInput multiline, required, min height 200, placeholder: "Share your thoughts..."

**"POST THREAD" button** at bottom. On press: haptic, Alert "Thread Posted!", navigate back.

**Style:** Same old-school form styling as CreateGroupScreen.

### PART 8: Navigation Updates

**File:** `client/navigation/RootStackNavigator.tsx`

Add these imports:
```typescript
import GroupBoardScreen from "@/screens/GroupBoardScreen";
import GroupThreadScreen from "@/screens/GroupThreadScreen";
import CreateGroupScreen from "@/screens/CreateGroupScreen";
import CreateThreadScreen from "@/screens/CreateThreadScreen";
```

Add to `RootStackParamList`:
```typescript
GroupBoard: { groupId: string; groupName: string };
GroupThread: { threadId: string; threadTitle: string; groupId: string };
CreateGroup: undefined;
CreateThread: { groupId: string };
```

Add Stack.Screen entries (inside the existing Stack.Navigator, after the ProofVault screen):
```tsx
<Stack.Screen
  name="GroupBoard"
  component={GroupBoardScreen}
  options={({ route }) => ({
    headerTitle: route.params.groupName.toUpperCase(),
  })}
/>
<Stack.Screen
  name="GroupThread"
  component={GroupThreadScreen}
  options={({ route }) => ({
    headerTitle: "",
  })}
/>
<Stack.Screen
  name="CreateGroup"
  component={CreateGroupScreen}
  options={{
    headerTitle: "CREATE GROUP",
  }}
/>
<Stack.Screen
  name="CreateThread"
  component={CreateThreadScreen}
  options={{
    headerTitle: "NEW THREAD",
  }}
/>
```

## CRITICAL STYLE RULES — OLD SCHOOL FORUM AESTHETIC

1. **NO rounded cards with shadows.** Use `borderWidth: 1` and `borderColor: theme.border` with sharp corners (`borderRadius: 4` max, or use `BorderRadius.sm`).
2. **Borders touching.** Thread rows, post rows, and group rows should have NO vertical gaps. The bottom border of one row IS the top border of the next (use `borderBottomWidth: 1` only).
3. **Data-dense.** Show stats everywhere: reply counts, view counts, post counts, member counts, join dates, streaks. Forums are information-rich.
4. **Monospace numbers.** Use `fontFamily: Platform.select({ ios: "Menlo", default: "monospace" })` for numeric stats (reply counts, view counts, post counts).
5. **Uppercase section headers.** All section/category headers: uppercase, letterSpacing: 2, fontSize: 11, fontWeight: "700".
6. **Muted palette.** The only color pops should be `theme.accent` (red) for hot threads, new post dots, official badges, and OP tags. Everything else uses `theme.text`, `theme.textSecondary`, and borders.
7. **Separator lines.** Use thin 1px borders to separate content, not spacing/gaps.
8. **No emojis in UI chrome.** The 📌 and 🔒 in thread titles are exceptions because they're in user content. UI elements (buttons, labels, badges) should use icons or text only.

- Any existing components (PostCard, FAB, HeaderTitle, etc.)
