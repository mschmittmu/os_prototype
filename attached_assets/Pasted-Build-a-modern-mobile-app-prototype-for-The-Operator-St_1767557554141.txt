Build a modern mobile app prototype for "The Operator Standard" - a discipline and accountability lifestyle app. This should feel like the command center for people taking control of their lives. Think: the intensity of a military ops dashboard meets the polish of Strava meets the community of Discord.
BRAND ESSENCE

Philosophy: "The Operator Sets The Standard. The AI Enforces It."
Core Values: Discipline Over Emotion, Extreme Accountability, Truth First Always, Physical Excellence, Mission Over Self, Strength Through Pain, Build What Lasts, Brotherhood Is A Weapon, Zero Regression, The Standard Owns You Now, Earned Respect
Tone: Commanding, no-BS, warrior mentality, but supportive brotherhood
The buffalo is the symbol (strength, resilience, charges into the storm)

Text: Pure white (#FFFFFF) and muted gray (#9CA3AF)
Success states: Emerald green (#10B981)
