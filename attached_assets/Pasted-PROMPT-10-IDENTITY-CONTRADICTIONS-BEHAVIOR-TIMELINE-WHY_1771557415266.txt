PROMPT 10: IDENTITY CONTRADICTIONS + BEHAVIOR TIMELINE
WHY LAST: This requires all previous data to exist — identity claims from onboarding, task completion data from Night Reflection, strike history from Enforcement, domain scores from Life Score. This is where ARCANE "feels intelligent."
Files to Create
client/screens/BehaviorHistoryScreen.tsx (~320 lines)
The permanent record. Scrollable timeline of every significant behavioral event.
Layout:

Header

"BEHAVIOR RECORD" — uppercase
"Your history never resets." — subtitle, secondary text
Total days tracked: "156 DAYS ON RECORD"


Filter Chips (horizontal scroll)

All / Wins / Losses / Strikes / Milestones / Proof
Tappable to filter timeline


Timeline (FlatList, reverse chronological)

Each entry is a timeline node with:

Left: date (compact: "Feb 19")
Center: vertical timeline line with colored dot
Right: event card


Event card types:

Win: Green dot, "WIN — 5/5 completed", streak count
Loss: Red dot, "LOSS — 3/5 completed", streak impact
Strike: Orange dot, "STRIKE ASSIGNED — Pattern failure", severity
Strike Cleared: Blue dot, "STRIKE CLEARED — Recovery completed"
Streak Milestone: Gold dot, "30-DAY STREAK", life score at time
Proof Captured: Purple dot, "PROOF — [milestone tag]", thumbnail
Identity Contradiction: Red/orange dot, "CONTRADICTION DETECTED — [claim vs behavior]"


Each card has an expand arrow for details (optional for prototype)


Summary Stats Footer

Total wins / Total losses / Win rate
Longest streak / Total strikes / Current Life Score



client/components/IdentityContradictionCard.tsx (~120 lines)
Reusable card component for displaying contradictions. Used in:

Morning Brief (Section 3: Pattern Intelligence — if contradiction is the current pattern)
Behavior History timeline
Standalone notification-style card on HomeScreen (future)

Card Layout:

Red/orange left border (3px)
Warning icon + "IDENTITY CONTRADICTION" label
Claim text: "You said: '[identity claim from onboarding]'"
Evidence text: "Reality: [behavioral evidence]"
Domain affected + domain score
Date detected

Contradiction Examples (in mock data):

Claim: "I'm becoming disciplined" → Evidence: "4 losses in 7 days"
Claim: "Family is my priority" → Evidence: "Zero relationship tasks in 10 days"
Claim: "I'm building financial freedom" → Evidence: "Financial tasks avoided 6 times this month"

client/lib/contradictionLogic.ts (~60 lines)

ContradictionRule interface: { claimPattern: string, triggerCondition: string, outputTemplate: string, domain: string }
CONTRADICTION_RULES constant from ARCANE spec
detectContradictions(claims: string[], behaviorData: any): Contradiction[]

Files to Modify
client/lib/mockData.ts

Add behaviorHistory: BehaviorEvent[] — 20+ events spanning 2 months of mock history

Mix of wins (mostly), losses, strikes, milestones, proof captures, contradictions
Should tell a realistic story: early struggles → building streak → occasional setbacks → growth


Add contradictions: Contradiction[] — 2-3 active contradictions
Add BehaviorEvent interface, Contradiction interface

client/screens/MorningBriefScreen.tsx (Prompt 6 version)

In the Pattern Intelligence section, check if there's an active contradiction
If yes, render IdentityContradictionCard instead of generic pattern text
Contradictions take priority over regular patterns (they're more impactful)

client/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx

Add "Behavior History" row (clock icon) in profile settings
Navigate to BehaviorHistoryScreen

client/screens/LifeScoreScreen.tsx (Prompt 7)

Update the "VIEW FULL BEHAVIOR HISTORY" link to actually navigate to BehaviorHistoryScreen

client/navigation/RootStackNavigator.tsx

Add BehaviorHistory: undefined to params
Register screen
