PROMPT 6: MORNING BRIEF REWORK + SETTINGS ACCESS
WHY SECOND: Now that Night Reflection generates real data, Morning Brief can reference it. Also fixing the "feels like onboarding" problem.
The Problem with Current Morning Brief
The current Morning Brief is full-screen swipeable cards with auto-advance timers on a black background. This works for onboarding (one-time dramatic reveal) but fails as a daily tool because:

Auto-advance feels rushed for a daily review
Full-screen black cards feel like a setup wizard
No way to re-access it after dismissal
Swipe-to-advance is the same interaction pattern as onboarding

The Rework
Transform Morning Brief from "onboarding-style card deck" to "daily intelligence briefing" — a single scrollable screen that feels like reading a classified document, not stepping through a wizard.
Files to Create
client/screens/MorningBriefScreen.tsx — FULL REWRITE (~400 lines)
Replace the swipeable card system with a single scrollable briefing document. Think: military intelligence brief, not app onboarding.
Layout (top to bottom, single scroll):

Briefing Header

"MORNING BRIEF" — uppercase, letterSpacing 3, centered
Date: "WEDNESDAY // FEB 19, 2026"
Horizontal divider line (1px, accent color)


Section 1: IDENTITY ANCHOR (always first)

Section label: "01 // IDENTITY" — small, uppercase, accent color
User's identity declaration from onboarding in quotes
Italic, slightly larger font
Subtle left border accent (3px, accent color)


Section 2: YESTERDAY'S RESULT (skip if first day or no data)

Section label: "02 // YESTERDAY"
Result card: WIN or LOSS with completion stats
If WIN: "5/5 COMPLETED. STREAK: 48 DAYS." — green accent
If LOSS: "3/5 COMPLETED. STREAK BROKEN." — red accent
Compact, data-dense — not a full dramatic slide


Section 3: PATTERN INTELLIGENCE (skip if first time user)

Section label: "03 // PATTERN DETECTED"
The pattern call-out text from morningBriefLogic.ts
Displayed in a bordered box with warning icon
Examples: "You tend to lose after 3 consecutive wins." / "Financial tasks avoided 4x this week."


Section 4: TODAY'S NON-NEGOTIABLES

Section label: "04 // TODAY'S POWER LIST"
Numbered list of today's 5 tasks (pulled from storage)
Each task shows category tag
If no tasks set yet: "NO TASKS SET. GO TO EXECUTION TAB." with button


Section 5: ARCANE DIRECTIVE

Section label: "05 // DIRECTIVE"
Single commanding sentence from ARCANE
Large font, bold, centered
This is the "single directive" Andy described: "Your problem is not effort. It's consistency."


Dismiss Button

"ACKNOWLEDGED" — full-width button at bottom
On press: marks brief as seen, navigates to Home
NOT "Let's go" or "Start" — this isn't onboarding. "Acknowledged" = military/operator tone



Key Differences from Current:

NO auto-advance timers
NO swipe navigation between cards
NOT full-screen black — uses standard theme background with section cards
Scrollable at user's pace
Section numbers (01, 02, 03...) give it a classified document feel
Can be re-accessed anytime from Settings
Still shows on app launch if not yet viewed today (existing initialRoute logic stays)

Files to Modify
client/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx

Add new "ARCANE" section between OPERATOR MODE and NOTIFICATIONS
Two rows:

"Morning Brief" — sunrise icon, accent background icon circle

Subtitle: "View today's intelligence briefing"
Chevron-right, navigates to MorningBrief


"Night Reflection" — moon icon, accent background icon circle

Subtitle: "Complete your daily debrief"
Chevron-right, navigates to NightReflection




Both use same settings row styling as existing Operator Mode row

client/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx

In the SETTINGS_SECTIONS constant, add to the first section's items:

{ icon: "sunrise", label: "Morning Brief", screen: "MorningBrief" }
{ icon: "moon", label: "Night Reflection", screen: "NightReflection" }


These appear in the Profile's settings list alongside existing items

client/lib/morningBriefLogic.ts

Keep all existing logic (getYesterdayResult, getPatternCallOut, getDirective, isFirstTimeUser)
These functions are still used — they just feed into a different UI layout now
Add: getFormattedBriefDate(): string — returns "WEDNESDAY // FEB 19, 2026" format

client/navigation/RootStackNavigator.tsx

MorningBrief screen already registered — no change needed
Ensure NightReflection was registered in Prompt 5

client/lib/storage.ts

No changes needed — saveMorningBriefState/getMorningBriefState already exist

What Gets Deleted

The entire swipeable card rendering system (renderIdentityAnchor, renderYesterdayResult, etc. as separate card functions)
PagerView / ScrollView with pagingEnabled horizontal scroll
Auto-advance timer logic (AUTO_ADVANCE_MS)
Dot indicator / progress dots at bottom
The first-time user card deck (renderFirstTimeWelcome, renderFirstTimeSetup, renderFirstTimeDirective)

What Gets Kept (for first-time users)

isFirstTimeUser() check still runs
If first time: show a simplified brief with just Identity Anchor + "HOW THIS WORKS" section + "SET YOUR FIRST POWER LIST" button
Same content as current first-time flow, but rendered as sections in the new scrollable layout instead of swipeable cards
