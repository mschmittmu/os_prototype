PROMPT 7: LIFE SCORE DEEP DIVE
WHY THIRD: The HUD already shows Life Score and 8 domains. This prompt makes them tappable and adds the detail screen that shows HOW scores are calculated and WHERE weaknesses live.
Files to Create
client/screens/LifeScoreScreen.tsx (~380 lines)
Tapping the LifeScoreRing on HomeScreen navigates here. This is the "deep mode" Andy described — trends, gaps, failure patterns, actionable intel.
Layout (scrollable):

Score Header

Large Life Score number (centered, 72pt, color-coded)
Gauge arc underneath (larger version of HomeScreen ring)
Trend line text: "+2 this week • +8 this month"
Score tier label: "ADVANCING" (60-79) / "DOMINANT" (80-100) / "STRUGGLING" (40-59) / "CRITICAL" (<40)


Score Breakdown Card

"COMPOSITE BREAKDOWN" header
Visual showing the formula components:

Weighted Domain Average: 70% weight — show calculated value
Consistency Bonus: 15% weight — show current bonus
Trend Bonus: 15% weight — show current bonus
Weakness Penalty: show subtracted amount (red) and which domain triggered it


This demystifies the score — users see exactly why they're at 73


Domain Grid (8 domains, 2 columns)

Each domain is a tappable card showing:

Domain name (uppercase)
Score (large number, color-coded)
Mini trend indicator (up/down arrow + delta)
Small progress bar


Sorted by score (lowest first — weakest link philosophy)
Lowest domain has a red border / "WEAKEST LINK" badge


Weekly Trend Chart

Section header: "7-DAY TREND"
Simple line chart showing Life Score for each of the last 7 days
Mock data points: [68, 69, 71, 70, 72, 71, 73]
Dots on each day, labeled with day abbreviation (M T W T F S S)
Uses SVG Path for the line, Circle for dots


Domain Insights

Section header: "ARCANE ANALYSIS"
2-3 insight cards, each with:

Icon + domain name
Insight text (from mock data)


Examples:

"RELATIONSHIPS is your weakest domain at 29. Zero relationship tasks logged in 10 days."
"RECOVERY declining. Average 6 days to bounce back from losses."
"DISCIPLINE is your strongest attribute. Maintain the standard."




History Link

"VIEW FULL BEHAVIOR HISTORY →" text link at bottom
Navigates to BehaviorHistoryScreen (built in Prompt 10)
For now, just show the link — screen doesn't exist yet, so wrap in a disabled state or Alert
