PROMPT 8: ENFORCEMENT & STRIKE SYSTEM
WHY FOURTH: Now the daily loop exists (Morning Brief → Execute → Night Reflection → Score) and scores are visible. Time to add consequence. This is where the prototype stops being a tool and becomes a system.
Files to Create
client/screens/StrikeHistoryScreen.tsx (~250 lines)
Accessible from Profile. Shows all strikes — active and historical.
Layout:

Strike Status Header

Current active strikes: large number, color-coded by tier
Tier badge: "GREEN" / "YELLOW" / "ORANGE" / "RED" with matching color
Tier description: "Normal operation" / "Elevated pressure" / "Restricted mode" / "Critical intervention"


Escalation Tier Visual

Horizontal tier bar showing all 4 tiers
Current tier highlighted/filled
Strike count thresholds labeled: 0-1 / 2-3 / 4-5 / 6+


Active Strikes List

Each strike shows:

Strike reason icon + text ("Daily loss" / "Critical task missed" / "Pattern failure" / "Reflection skipped")
Severity badge (Standard / Elevated / Pattern / Behavioral)
Date assigned
"CLEAR" button (tappable, for prototype demo — in production this would require recovery action)




Strike History (scrollable)

All-time strikes in reverse chronological order
Each entry: date, reason, severity, status (active/cleared), clear method
"Total strikes all time: 14" summary at top



client/components/StrikeBadge.tsx (~60 lines)

Small component showing active strike count
Color-coded by tier (green/yellow/orange/red)
Used on ProfileScreen and HomeScreen

client/components/EscalationOverlay.tsx (~120 lines)

Overlay component that renders on restricted screens when user is in Orange/Red tier
Orange tier: Semi-transparent overlay on Social feed with message "RESTRICTED MODE — Complete recovery protocol to restore access"
Red tier: Full lock screen with "CRITICAL INTERVENTION — Feed locked. Recovery required." and link to what they need to do
Takes tier as prop, renders appropriate overlay

client/lib/strikeLogic.ts (~100 lines)

StrikeRule interface: { trigger: string, severity: string, strikeValue: number }
STRIKE_RULES constant with all rules from ARCANE spec
calculateEscalationTier(activeStrikes: number): "green" | "yellow" | "orange" | "red"
getTierConfig(tier): { color: string, label: string, description: string, restrictions: string[] }
getStrikeReasonDisplay(reason: string): { icon: string, label: string }

Files to Modify
client/lib/mockData.ts

Add strikes array: Strike[] with 3 active + 5 historical
Add Strike interface: { id, reason, severity, strikeValue, date, status: "active"|"cleared", clearedDate?, clearMethod? }

client/lib/storage.ts
